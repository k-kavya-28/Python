#most common example of tuples is coordinates, let's say a series of x,y coordinates
#TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE i.e. cannot be modified or changes later once created
#Tuples are used for data that should not be changed, like coordinates


# coordinates = (4, 5)
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)]  #list of tuples(coordinates)
print(coordinates[0])
